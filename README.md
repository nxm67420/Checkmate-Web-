# Checkmate-Web-
(*This application requires the download of Scene Builder) Java project that demonstrates the usage of String Builder, FXML,  in addition to JDBC, &amp; MySQL Database Tools

Welcome to my Checkmate Web Application that is running off of Tomcat Server. Checkmate is a class project that I personally created myself using tools such as 
Java JDBC, Tomcat Server, and Java Thread Tools. This project was created to demonstrate my usage of these tools with an empahasis on MySQL Database.
(*Also have knowledge of SQL). Below are images with descriptive outlines demonstrating what is going on.
The basis of the project is for students to create a login, creating a session/event for other students to see and may join or create their own session based on specific 
location, topic, date & time.

1.This is the Home Page / Login Screen where users are started off to log in by using there personal'username' & 'password' taht was created on the Register Page.
User information, username/password, are grasped from the MySQL Database and allow user login. Incorrect Input will result in a warning error and will instruct 
users to TRY AGAIN!!

2.This is the Register Page as mentioned before, where users are allowed to fill in personal information that will allow them access into the sites pages.

3.Next, users are allowed to create an event for other students to see, and may join if they wish, or create their own event in which they hope others will 
join also.

4.Finally, we have the Results Page which grabs all created sessions from the Database and display into one single page where students can see all upcoming events.
